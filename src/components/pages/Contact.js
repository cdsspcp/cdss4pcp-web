                                        <p className="lead">Dr. Jing has been educated and trained in medical informatics (M.D.), health
                                            informatics (Ph.D.), and clinical informatics (postdoctoral training). She has
                                            conducted health informatics research in China, UK, and the USA with her
                                            supervisors, mentors, and independently in the past.
                                            Her main research interests involve developing new methods, models, and
                                            applications to facilitate biomedical researchers, clinicians, and healthcare
                                            administrators, directly or indirectly, to make better-informed decisions
                                            when utilizing existing evidence. Her lab at Clemson University is Health
                                            Informatics-Decisions and Evidence <strong>(HI-D&E)</strong>.
                                            On the basic science of health informatics, she and her collaborators conduct
                                            controlled studies to explore clinicians’ research hypothesis generation
                                            process via secondary data analytic tools (funded via NIH R15). On the
                                            applied science of health informatics, CDSS4PCP is an example. CDSS4PCP
                                            intends to explore reusable generic machine-executable rules for CDC-
                                            recommended immunization schedules in primary care settings without in-
                                            house technical support. In addition, exploring telemedicine in rural areas,
                                            exploring the measurement of an individual&#39;s health status, and clinically
                                            actionable genomic information is also on her research agenda. She is
                                            honored to be part of the NIH-funded T15 grant for the Clemson-MUSC joint
                                            BDSI program. She teaches various graduate and undergraduate courses on
                                            health informatics.
                                            She also serves as a reviewer for multiple health informatics journals,
                                            conferences, and proposals and provides services via the American Medical
                                            Informatics Association (AMIA). Currently, Dr. Jing also serves as an AHA
